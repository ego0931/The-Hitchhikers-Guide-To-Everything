  <h1>The Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster</h1>
  <p>The best drink in existence. Its effects are like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick. The recipe involves an olive from the planet Oliphaunt, three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin, and a tooth from an Algolian Suntiger. Mix with caution, and never drink more than two unless you're a 30-ton mega-elephant with bronchial pneumonia.</p>
